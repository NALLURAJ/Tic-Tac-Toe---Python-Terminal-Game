# Tic-Tac-Toe---Python-Terminal-Game
This is a terminal-based 2-player Tic Tac Toe game made using Python. It lets two players take turns entering their moves, and the game checks for a winner or a tie after every turn.

##  How It Works

- The game prints a 3x3 board using ASCII formatting.
- Two players take turns (X and O) choosing rows and columns to place their mark.
- It checks for all possible win conditions after each move.
- The game ends when either player wins or when all cells are filled (a tie).

##  Features

- Clean board UI with row/column selection
- Input validation (invalid rows/columns or already occupied cells)
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Game tie detection when the board is full

##  How to Run

1. Save the code in a file called `tic_tac_toe.py`
2. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
